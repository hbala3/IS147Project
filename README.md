## Project Description

Our project is an online banking system which aims to solve the problem of inefficiency and inconvenience in traditional banking systems.

### Information

#### Use of Docker
Docker is an application that lets you build, ship, and run containerized applications in lightweight and portable containers. Some of the basic uses of Docker are application deployment, development and testing, microservices architecture, and continuous integration. Docker makes applications consistent and easy to deploy anywhere.

#### Use of Docker and GitHub Action
Our project uses Docker to create a consistent and portable environment for building and running the application across differet systems. GitHub Actions is implemented to help with handling tasks such as testing, building Docker images, and deploying updates when changes are pushed to the repository. Overall Docker and GitHub Actions are used to enhance development and deployment efficiency.

#### Use of JavaDocs
In our project, JavaDocs are used to provide clear and structured documentation for all classes and methods that make up our Banking System. They describe what each part of the system does--such as creating accounts, depositing money, withdrawing funds, and checking balances. JavaDocs makes the system easier to maintain, update, and extend in the future.
